# Random Forest Classification
# Ensemble methods take the predictions from two or more models and combine them into a single prediction.
# In this way, ensemble methods are models of models or metaÂ­models.
# They are a powerful set of techniques for getting better results from existing models.
# Decision trees like CART and randomly created trees are a popular base model for creating ensembles.

# The Random Forest ensemble method creates a number of decision trees, each on a different subset of the dataset.
# Generally the approach to creating an ensemble used by random forest is called bootstrap aggregation
# (or bagging for short).
